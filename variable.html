        <h3># What is variable in Java?</h3>
        <p>A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. OR<br/>
            Variable is a name of memory location. In other words, it is a name which is associated with a value that can be changed.</p>
     </div>

     <div>
         <h3># How many types of variable are available in Java?</h3>
         <p>There are three types of variables in Java:
             <ul>
                 <li>local variable</li>
                 <li>instance variable</li>
                 <li>static variable</li>
             </ul>   
        </p>
     </div>

     <div>
        <h3># How to Declare a variable in Java?</h3>
        <p>
            To declare a variable follow this syntax:<br/>
            data_type variable_name = value;<br/>
            here value is optional because in java, you can declare the variable first and then later assign the value to it.
        </p>
     </div>

     <div>

     </div>

     <div>
         <h3># What is local variable?</h3>
         <p>A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. 
             You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable is exist.<br/>

            A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.<br/><br/>
            These variables are declared inside method of the class. Their scope is limited to the method which means that You canâ€™t change their values and access them outside of the method.
         </p>
     </div>

     <div>
         <h3># What is instance variable?</h3>
         <p>A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called instance variable. It is not declared as static.<br/>

            It is called instance variable because its value is instance specific and is not shared among instances.

         </p>
     </div>

     <div>
        <h3># What is static variable?</h3>
        <p>A variable which is declared as static is called static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of static variable and share among all the instances of the class. 
            Memory allocation for static variable happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.
        </p>
    </div>

     <div>
         <h3># What is the difference between primitive variables and reference variables?</h3>
     </div>
